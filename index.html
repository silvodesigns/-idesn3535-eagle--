				<p>The website is fully responsive and is able to switch its layout depending on the screen size the website is being visited from.</p>

					<li><img src="class01/homework/desktopWireframe.jpg"/></li>
				</ul>
				<p>The website starts at the mobile version with a single column layout and it eventually becomes a two column layout in the desktop version. There are some minor differences between each layout but they all can access the same content</p>

					<p>I chose this website because of its unique colors, predominat geometric shapes and  effective execution of a dynamic and responsive layout </p>
